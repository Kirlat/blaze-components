# Blaze Components <sup>1.1.0</sup>
A library of reusable front end components. The goal of creating this library was to streamline and simplify a front end development work. Components are created to be reusable, have minimal dependencies, and can be dropped to any new or existing code easily with minimal effort. Let's keep it DRY!

Each component is independent from the other. However, some components may have external dependencies. In cases like this such dependencies will be listed for each component individually.

Please check [documentation](docs/components.html) for information about individual components.
